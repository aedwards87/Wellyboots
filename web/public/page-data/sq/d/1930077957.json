Greg and Kelly work together to manage Wellyboots Dar Care.\n\nPreviously they were a sole trading company, then in 2020 they became a Limited Company which unfortunately meant that the Ofsted reports they had obtained over the years could no longer be associated with Wellyboots Day Care, those previous reports were ‘Good’ and ‘Outstanding’.\n\nHer family live in the top part of Roodlands Farm House; the lower part has three large rooms just for the children they care for. There the children are given the opportunities to learn, grow and develop.\n\nAs a person, Kelly is calm and friendly with a very slightly wacky side!\nShe is creative and enjoys all aspects of creativity; and loves to be outside, either in the garden, walking in the woods or spending time with her horses.\n\nKelly has worked in childcare and education since 1997, ranging from private day nurseries, a nanny, childminding, education support for children with disabilities, A.S.D, speech, language and communication delays and more.\n\nWhen developing Wellyboots Day Care, she obtained various qualifications in working with children and young people. These include a degree in Early years and education, also qualifications in child development, special educational needs, particularly children with Autistic spectrum disorder.\n\nAdditionally, because she is a firm believer in the importance of play, she obtained a qualification in Transitioning to Playwork."}]}]},"accreditations":[{"asset":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[],"fallback":{"src":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/wc5d2m7h/production/a224c424c2f2ae4fa0cc9349ee13c27fc945b222-466x100.png?rect=0,0,465,100&w=400&h=86&auto=format","srcSet":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/wc5d2m7h/production/a224c424c2f2ae4fa0cc9349ee13c27fc945b222-466x100.png?rect=1,0,464,100&w=320&h=69&auto=format
